If the guess is correct, the user wins! But if the guess is incorrect, the program will inform the user either that the guess is too low, or too high, depending on the case.\n",

Since we’ll do this check multiple times in each game, write a function to handle this comparison. We should also think forward a bit and use the output of the game to indicate whether or not the game is over. We can use a boolean `True` to indicate that the player has won, and a boolean `False` to indicate that the player still needs more guesses.\n",
